    Demonstrating specificity:
    - This class has higher specificity than generic <strong> tag styling.
    - This will override inherited styles from body if applied.

  /* Footer styling from external CSS */
  footer {
    font-style: italic; /* Applied unless overridden by internal CSS */
  }
  
  /*
  Rules overridden by intenal <style> block:
  - the external CSS file originally set the <h1> color to green, but the internal <style> block changed it to yellow
  - the external CSS file set the <footer> font-style to italic, but the internal <style> block changed it to normal
  - external CSS did not define a background color, but the internal <style> block set it to beige

  Rules overridden by Inline Styles::
  - the inline <<h1 style="color:#641b1b; font-family:'Courier New';"> directly changes the color to dark red and the font to Courier New, overriding both the internal and external CSS rules

  Observations on Cascade & Inheritance:
  - the cascade follows a hierarchy: external CSS-> internal CSS-> inline CSS(highest priority)
  -inheritance allows child elements like <p> to receive styles from parent elements like <body> unless overridden by a more specific rule
